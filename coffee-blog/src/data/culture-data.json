      "fullContent": "The Ethiopian coffee ceremony is a unique and important part of Ethiopian culture. This intimate ceremony can last for hours and is typically performed by the woman of the household. The ceremony begins with the washing of green coffee beans, then roasting them in a pan over hot coals. The aromatic smoke is wafted around for everyone to appreciate, and the beans are then ground using a traditional mortar and pestle. The coffee is brewed three times: the first round called 'Abol', the second 'Tona', and the third 'Baraka'. Each round becomes progressively weaker but is equally important to the ceremony.",
